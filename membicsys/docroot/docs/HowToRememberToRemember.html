<h2>Augmented Memory</h2>

<p>Amassing a trove of helpful links can make you feel like your
positive memory has doubled, but it only works if you remember to
create a membic when you discover something noteworthy.  Here's how to
remember to remember: </p>

<ol>

<li>When you find something memorable, don't lose it. Put it on your
"to do" list.  Email it to yourself.  Save it to your reading.  Put it
on your calendar.  Put it on your shopping list.  Do whatever you
usually do to keep track of something small that you want to deal with.

<li><img src="../img/writenew.png" class="hthimg"/> Make a membic.  Paste
the URL and click the <em>"Read"</em> button, or choose a type and
use the autocomplete to help fill out the details.

</ol>

<h2>Extras</h2>

<p>Most of the time you're probably reading on your phone, so you just
copy the link location, open membic and paste the URL.  You can add
Membic to your home screen to make that easier.  Here's some other fun
extras to check out if they match how you internet: </p>

<ul>

<li>The Membic <span class="lititlespan">Bookmarklet</span> is a tiny
snippet of code that takes the URL of any page you are viewing and
passes it along to Membic in a new browser tab.  After installing, you
can select "Make Membic" from your bookmarks to start writing a membic
for any page you are on.  Here's how to install the bookmarklet:
  <ul>
    <li><em>Firefox</em>
      <ol>
        <li>"Right click" this link <img src="../img/arrow12right.png"> <a href="javascript:(function(){window.open('https://membic.com?newrev=&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href));})();" style="font-weight:bold;">Make&nbsp;Membic</a> and choose "Bookmark This Link".
      </ol>
    <li><em>Chrome/Safari</em>
      <ol>
        <li>"Right click" this link <img src="../img/arrow12right.png"> <a href="javascript:(function(){window.open('https://membic.com?newrev=&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href));})();" style="font-weight:bold;">Make&nbsp;Membic</a> and choose "Copy Link Address".
        <li>Bookmarks | Bookmark This Page...
        <li>Edit... change the bookmark name to "Make Membic", replace
          the URL with the copied link.  Save.
      </ol>
  </ul>
  The next time you are reading something memorable, select "Make
  Membic" from your bookmarks to make a membic for it.

<li><p><span class="lititlespan">Mail In</span> your membic by sending
mail to
<a href="mailto:membic@membicsys.appspotmail.com">membic@membicsys.appspotmail.com</a>.
Describe why it is memorable in the subject line.  In the body of the
mail message, the first line starting with "http://" or "https://" is
used for the URL.  Mailing in will create a future membic you can fill
out next time you are online.  Find your mailed-in membics on the
remembered tab <img src="../img/tabmemo.png" class="itximg"/> of your
profile <img src="../img/profile.png" class="itximg"/>. </p>

<li><p>If you would like to build playlists from keywords, and update
your top music membics automatically
from <span class="lititlespan">iTunes&reg;</span>, check out the
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/itsip"
   onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/itsip');return false;">
situational playlist generator project on github.</a></p>

</ul>
