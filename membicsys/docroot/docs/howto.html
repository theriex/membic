<h3>Community membics <img src="img/membiclogo.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>When you first open membic.com, or click the main logo, you see the
most recent membics posted by the community.  What you see is filtered
automatically for you, but if you particularly like or dislike what
someone is posting you can click the <img src="img/nopref.png"
class="intxtico"/> under their picture to prefer, background, or block
membics from them (they won't know). </p>

<p>If you only want to see membics of a particular type, you can use
the type toggle buttons at the top of the page.</p>

<p>If you see a membic that looks interesting, click the title to
expand actions and posting details.  If the membic was helpful or
remarkable (in a good way) you can <img src="img/helpful.png"
class="intxtico"/> it to show your appreciation.  Think of "star" as
kind of a hybrid "like" or "upvote" thing.  You can also click
<img src="img/rememberq.png" class="intxtico"/> to remember anything
you might want to follow up on later.  To make your own membic
from the one you are viewing, click <img src="img/writereview.png"
class="intxtico"/>. </p>

<h3>Making a membic <img src="img/writereview.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>Every membic has a type to help determine what fields and keywords
are most appropriate.  After selecting the most appropriate type, fill
in the URL if there is a page with details.  Click the "Read" button
to have membic.com attempt to read the URL and fill out details
automatically for you (some sites work better than others). </p>

<p>After identifying information is filled in, use the star rating
slider, the comment text area, and the keyword checkboxes to note your
impressions.  Think about this as writing a quick note to your future
self about what you think is most memorable.  If there are additional
keywords you want, just type them into the keywords box separated by
commas. </p>

<p>If you haven't finished the membic, but want to save the identifying
information for later, check the "future" checkbox and you can find
the membic again later by clicking <img src="img/remembered.png"
class="intxtico"/> (your memory). </p>

<h3>Your membics</h3>

<p>To access your membics, click "My membics".  Membic.com
automatically keeps track of your most recent membics
<img src="img/tablatest.png" class="intxtico"/>, and your top membics
of all time <img src="img/top.png" class="intxtico"/>.  The search tab
<img src="img/search.png" class="intxtico"/> allows you to quickly
locate membics you've written, even if it was a long time ago.  The
preferred tab <img src="img/prefer.png" class="intxtico"> provides
quick access to pen names you think are notable, and the themes tab
<img src="img/tabctms.png" class="intxtico"/> holds themes you are
following or are a member of.</p>

<p>To edit your profile details, click the gears icon next to your pen
name.  If you have a website or a blog you would like people to visit,
you can provide a link in your profile description. </p> 

<p>If you want to share your profile with others, click your name for
convenient share buttons and your profile permalink. </p>

<h3>Themes <img src="img/tabctms.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>If some of the membics you note are related to an ongoing interest,
you can create a theme to collect them.  Themes are similar to
profiles in that they track recent and top membics, and can be
searched, but themes can also support cooperative postings from
multiple members. </p>

<p>To find cooperative themes, look for a "Posted to" line in the
expanded membic display.  If it's there, you can click the link to
go to the theme, then click the follow button if you are interested
in the content.  If you are following, and would also like to
contribute content, you can apply for membership. </p>

<p>Themes provide workflow for content moderation, and member
management.  They also support RSS, can be linked to external event
calendars, and can be embedded into other websites.  Click the
settings button on the theme for details. </p>

<p>After creating or joining a theme, you'll have the option to post
through to it anytime you create or edit a membic. </p>
