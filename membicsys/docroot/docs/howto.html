<h3>Community membics <img src="img/membiclogo.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>When you first open membic.com, or click the main logo, you see the
most recent membics posted by the entire membic community.  What you
see is filtered automatically, but if you particularly like or dislike
what someone is posting you can click the (<img src="img/noprefsq.png"
class="intxtico"/>) under their picture to tune how visible they are to
you.  <i>Prefer</i> (<img src="img/promote.png" class="intxtico"/>)
sorts their posts ahead of all general posts.  <i>Endorse</i>
(<img src="img/endorse.png" class="intxtico"/>) shows you like what they
post but doesn't change the general sort order.  <i>Background</i>
(<img src="img/background.png" class="intxtico"/>) sorts their posts
below all general posts.  <i>Block</i> (<img src="img/block.png"
class="intxtico"/>) means you never see anything from them again. </p>

<p>If you only want to see membics of a particular type, you can use the 
<img src="img/TypeBook50.png" class="intxtico"/>
<img src="img/TypeArticle50.png" class="intxtico"/>
<img src="img/TypeMovie50.png" class="intxtico"/>

<img src="img/TypeActivity50.png" class="intxtico"/>
<img src="img/TypeOther50.png" class="intxtico"/>
toggle filter buttons at the top of the page.</p>

<p>If you see a membic that looks interesting, click the title to see
more.  If the membic was helpful or remarkable (in a good way) you can
<img src="img/helpful.png" class="intxtico"/> it to show your
appreciation.  Think of "star" as kind of a "like" or "upvote" thing.
You can also click <img src="img/rememberq.png" class="intxtico"/> to
remember anything you might want to follow up on later.  To make your
own membic from the one you are viewing, click
<img src="img/writereview.png" class="intxtico"/>. </p>

<h3>Making a membic <img src="img/writereview.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>Every membic has a type to help determine what fields and keywords
are most appropriate.  After selecting the most appropriate type, fill
in the URL (if available) and click the "Read" button to fill out
details automatically (some sites work better than others).  You can
also fill out details yourself. </p>

<p>After identifying information is filled in, write a sentence or two
describing why the link is memorable.  Use the star rating, and
keywords to provide more organizational detail.  Standard checkbox
keywords for each type are provided for convenience, you can also type
in any other keywords you want. </p>

<p>If you haven't finished the membic, but want to save the
identifying information for later, check the "future" checkbox and it
will be saved under your profile "remembered" tab.  After saving, you
can choose to share the membic to a variety of social networks. </p>

<div id="htprofdiv" class="docsecdiv" title="Your profile">
<div class="sectioncontent" title="">

<h3>Your profile <img src="img/profile.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>Your profile automatically keeps track of your most recent membics
(<img src="img/tablatest.png" class="intxtico"/>), your top membics of
all time (<img src="img/top.png" class="intxtico"/>), and any
remembered or future membics (<img src="img/tabmemo.png"
class="intxtico"/>).  The search tab (<img src="img/search.png"
class="intxtico"/>) allows you to quickly locate membics you've
written, even if it was a long time ago.  The endorsed profiles tab
(<img src="img/endorse.png" class="intxtico">) provides quick access
to pen names you think are worth listening to, and the themes tab
(<img src="img/tabctms.png" class="intxtico"/>) holds themes you are
following or are a member of.</p>

<p>To edit your profile details, click the gears icon next to your pen
name.  If you have a website or a blog you would like people to visit,
you can provide a link in your profile description. </p> 

<p>If you want to share your profile with others, click your name for
convenient share buttons and your profile permalink. </p>

<div class="sectioncontent" title="">

<h3>Themes <img src="img/tabctms.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>If several of your membics relate to a particular topic, you can
create a theme for easy access.  A theme is like a profile on steroids
that can optionally be run by a whole group of people.  Themes are
their own web pages that can be embedded into other sites, provide
a newsfeed, have their own access statistics and more. </p>

<p>To find themes, look for the "Posted to" line after the description
of any interesting membic you find.  If the membic was posted to a
theme, you can click the link see it.  When viewing a theme, click
"Follow" to add it to your profile.  After following, if you decide
you want to contribute, you can apply for membership status from the
settings (<img src="img/settings.png" class="intxtico"/>). <p>

<p>When you make a membic, you can post it through to any themes you
are a member of. </p>
