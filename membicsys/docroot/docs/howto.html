<h3>Community membics</h3>

<p>When you first open membic.com, or click the main logo, you see the
most recent membics posted by the community.  What you see is filtered
automatically for you, but if you particularly like or dislike what
someone is posting you can click the dot underneath their profile pic
to prefer, background, or block membics from them (they won't know).
To focus on a particular membic type, click one of the type buttons at
the top of the page. </p>

<p>If you see a membic that looks interesting, click the title to
expand actions and posting details.  If the membic was helpful or
remarkable (in a good way) you can <img src="img/helpful.png"
class="intxtico"/> it to show your appreciation.  Think of "star" as
kind of a hybrid "like" or "upvote" thing.  You can also click
<img src="img/rememberq.png" class="intxtico"/> to remember the membic
for later if you want to follow up on it.  To make your own membic
from the one you are viewing, click <img src="img/writereview.png"
class="intxtico"/>. </p>

<h3>Making a membic</h3>

<p>Every membic has a type to help determine what fields and keywords
are most appropriate.  After selecting the most appropriate type, fill
in the URL if there is a page with details.  Click the "Read" button
to have membic.com attempt to read the URL and fill out details
automatically for you (some sites work better than others). </p>

<p>After identifying information is filled in, use the star rating
slider, the comment text area, and the keyword checkboxes to note your
impressions.  Think about this as writing a quick note to your future
self about what you think is most memorable.  If there are additional
keywords you want, just type them into the keywords box separated by
commas. </p>

<p>If haven't finished the membic, but want to save the identifying
information for later, check the "future" checkbox and you can find
the membic again later by clicking <img src="img/remembered.png"
class="intxtico"/> (your memory). </p>

<h3>Your membics</h3>

<p>To access your membics, click "my membics".  Membic.com
automatically keeps track of your most recent membics
(<img src="img/tablatest.png" class="intxtico"/>) and your top membics
of all time (<img src="img/top.png" class="intxtico"/>).  The search
(<img src="img/search.png" class="intxtico"/> ) tab allows you to
quickly locate membics you've written, even if it was a long time ago.
The themes (<img src="img/tabctms.png" class="intxtico"/>) tab holds
themes you are following or are a member of.</p>

<p>To edit your profile details, click the gears icon next to your pen
name.  If you have a website or a blog you would like people to visit,
you can give the URL in your profile description. </p>

<h3>Themes</h3>

<p>If some percentage of the membics you make are related to an
ongoing interest of yours, you can create a theme to collect them.
Themes are similar to profiles in that they track recent and top
membics, and can be searched, but themes can also support cooperative
postings from multiple members. </p>

<p>To find cooperative themes, look for a "Posted to" line in the
expanded membic display.  If it's there, you can click the link to
go to the theme, then click the follow button if you are interested
in the content.  If you are following, and would also like to
contribute content, you can apply for membership. </p>

<p>Themes provide workflow for content moderation and member
management, support RSS, can be linked to external event calendars,
and can be embedded into other websites. </p>

<p>After creating or joining a theme, you'll have the option to post
through to it anytime you create or edit a membic. </p>
