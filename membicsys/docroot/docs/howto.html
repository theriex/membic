<h3>Community membics <img src="img/membiclogo.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>When you first open membic.com, or click the main logo, you see the
most recent membics posted by the entire membic community.  What you
see is filtered automatically for you, but if you particularly like or
dislike what someone is posting you can click the
<img src="img/nopref.png" class="intxtico"/> under their picture to
prefer, background, or block membics from them (they won't know). </p>

<p>If you only want to see membics of a particular type, you can use
the type toggle buttons at the top of the page.</p>

<p>If you see a membic that looks interesting, click the title to see
more.  If the membic was helpful or remarkable (in a good way) you can
<img src="img/helpful.png" class="intxtico"/> it to show your
appreciation.  Think of "star" as kind of a "like" or "upvote" thing.
You can also click <img src="img/rememberq.png" class="intxtico"/> to
remember anything you might want to follow up on later.  To make your
own membic from the one you are viewing, click
<img src="img/writereview.png" class="intxtico"/>. </p>

<div id="htwritediv" class="docsecdiv" title="Making a membic">

<h3>Making a membic <img src="img/writereview.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>Every membic has a type to help determine what fields and keywords
are most appropriate.  After selecting the most appropriate type, fill
in the URL (if available) and click the "Read" button to have
membic.com attempt to read the URL and fill out details automatically
for you (some sites work better than others).  You can also fill out
details yourself. </p>

<p>After identifying information is filled in, use the star rating
slider, the comment text area, and the keyword checkboxes to note your
impressions.  Think about this as writing a quick note to your future
self about what you think is most memorable.  If there are additional
keywords you want, just type them into the keywords box separated by
commas. </p>

<p>If you haven't finished the membic, but want to save the
identifying information for later, check the "future" checkbox and you
can find the membic again later under the "remembered" tab in your
profile. </p>

<div id="htprofdiv" class="docsecdiv" title="Your profile">

<h3>Your profile <img src="img/profile.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>Your profile automatically keeps track of your most recent membics
(<img src="img/tablatest.png" class="intxtico"/>), your top membics of
all time (<img src="img/top.png" class="intxtico"/>), and any remembered
or future membics (<img src="img/tabmemo.png" class="intxtico"/>).  The
search tab (<img src="img/search.png" class="intxtico"/>) allows you to
quickly locate membics you've written, even if it was a long time ago.
The preferred tab (<img src="img/prefer.png" class="intxtico">) provides
quick access to pen names you think are notable, and the themes tab
(<img src="img/tabctms.png" class="intxtico"/>) holds themes you are
following or are a member of.</p>

<p>To edit your profile details, click the gears icon next to your pen
name.  If you have a website or a blog you would like people to visit,
you can provide a link in your profile description. </p> 

<p>If you want to share your profile with others, click your name for
convenient share buttons and your profile permalink. </p>

<div id="htthemesdiv" class="docsecdiv" title="Themes">

<h3>Themes <img src="img/tabctms.png" class="hthimg"/></h3>

<p>If some of the membics you note are related to an ongoing interest,
you can create a theme to collect them.  Themes can be shared with
other people who have similar ongoing interests.  Themes support
cooperative postings from multiple members, recent/top membics, and
search. </p>

<p>To find cooperative themes, look for a "Posted to" line in the
membic display.  Click that link to go to the theme, then click the
follow button if you are interested in the content.  If you are
following a theme and find that you would like to add membics to that
theme as a contributor, you can apply for membership.  After creating
or joining a theme, you'll have the option to post through to it
anytime you create or edit a membic. </p>

<p>Themes support RSS, can be linked to external event calendars, and
can be embedded into other websites. These capabilities enable you to
connect your membics to your news feeds, social media, and web
presence. Click the settings button on a theme you are following for
details. </p>
