<h2>Browsing Memorable Links</h2>

<p>With your membics displayed inside of your own web site, and
visiting your theme by its direct address, you could pretty much skip
the main community membics display entirely.  It can be a distraction,
but glancing at memorable links from other people is fun, informative,
and favors serendipity.  To see the recent membics from the community
click the membic logo <img src="img/membiclogo.png" class="hthimg"/>.
</p>


<h2>Optimizing Random</h2>

<p>While it might look like a huge list, the community display updates
slowly.  That's because not everything is worth remembering.  You can
probably keep up with it, but here's how to optimize what gets
displayed for you:

<ol>

<li>When someone posts membics that you have zero interest in, or you
simply don't trust their judgment, click the
<img src="img/noprefsq.png" class="itximg"/> by their profile pic to
bring up the preferences dialog.  Select <img src="img/background.png"
class="itximg"/> to move their membics to the end of the display.
Then when you are scrolling through, you'll know when you've hit the
bottom of the barrel.

<li>When someone posts membics that are interesting and thoughtful,
click the <img src="img/noprefsq.png" class="itximg"/> by their
profile pic to bring up the preferences dialog and select
<img src="img/endorse.png" class="itximg"/>.  Now you can
differentiate between people you are not familar with, and those whose
judgment you trust.  Reading goes much faster when you know whether
you trust the source already.

<li>If a membic was particularly helpful, click the
<img src="img/stackedmenu.png" class="itximg"/> next to its title and
<img src="img/helpful.png" class="itximg"/> star it.  That gives
positive feedback to the person posting and has other beneficial
effects.

</ol>

<p>The "nuclear" tuning options (prefer <img src="img/promote.png"
class="itximg"/> and block <img src="img/block.png" class="itximg"/>)
are there if you need them.  Prefer means you will see everything from
that person before you see anything from anyone else.  Block makes
someone completely disappear from your world view forever.  We take
blocking seriously.  Any person you block will not know that you
blocked them, but that's one of the ways community administrators are
alerted to to unwelcome members.
</p>

<p>When you are viewing your own membics, there's a count of how many
people have starred it.  Membic does not support general conversation
due to the potential for abuse, but positive feedback is good. </p>

<p>With tuning, your community feed can be a great source of new
information. </p>
