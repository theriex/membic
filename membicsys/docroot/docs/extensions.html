<p><b>Membic bookmarklet:</b></p>

<p>To create a membic in one click from any site, "right click" the
following link and add it to your bookmarks:</p>

  <div id="bookslidediv">
    <div class="bookmarkletlinkdiv">
      <a href="javascript:(function(){window.open('http://www.membic.com?newrev=&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href));})();"
         style="border: 2px solid #999; padding:2px; background:#ccc; font-weight:bold;">Make&nbsp;Membic</a>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Then whenever you are on a site you want to create a membic for,
select "Make Membic" from your bookmarks and the script will open a
new browser window passing along the url. </p>

<p><b>iTunes playlist generator:</b></p>

<p>These 3 AppleScript files enable to you to characterize your tracks
and automatically build situational playlists: <p>

<ul>

<li><b>MembicReview</b> is run anytime you are listening to a track.
It prompts you to select appropriate keywords, provide an overall
rating, decide how often the track should be selected, and add any
other comments you want.

<li><b>MembicPlaylist</b> creates or updates a playlist built from
keyword values and a minimum quality rating, not including anything
that has been selected too recently.

<li><b>MembicExport</b> copies the playlist and source tracks out to
another folder.  Handy for copying music to an Android phone.

</ul>

<p>The scripts work directly within iTunes using the rating and
comment fields.  No modifications are required, and existing field
values are preserved. <p>

<p>To get Membic script support for iTunes: </p>
<ol>

<li><a href="../downloads/iTunesMac.zip">Download iTunesMac.zip</a>

<li>Double click the downloaded <code>iTunesMac.zip</code> to expand it.

<li>Double click <code>Install.scpt</code> to open it in the
AppleScript Editor.  Click the big green "Run" button and quit the
AppleScript Editor after it finishes.

<li>From iTunes, select a script from the scrolly looking thingy in
the top menu bar.

</ol>

<p>You might find it handy to set up a keyboard shortcut for
MembicReview: </p>

<ol>

<li>Open System Preferences | "Keyboard" | "Application Shortcuts"

<li>Click '+' to add a new shortcut

<li>Select "iTunes" as the application, <code>MembicReview</code> as
the menu title, and <code>command-;</code> as the keyboard shortcut
(iTunes already has default keybindings for most other keys).

</ol>
