<h2>Collaborating on a Membic Theme</h2>

<p>Posting links collaboratively extends the variety and increases the
quality of helpful links by reflecting the knowledge and experience of
everyone involved.  Collaboration is powerful, but without trust and
clear process things have a tendency to get messy.  Here's how to
collaborate on a theme: </p>

<ol>

<li><span class="lititlespan">Follow</span> a theme to show you are
interested in it, and to gain access to the theme settings
<img src="img/settings.png" class="hthimg"/> button.  As a follower
you can't make any changes, but you can read the
<img src="img/rssicon.png" class="itximg"/> <em>RSS</em> newsfeed and
<img src="img/embed.png" class="itximg"/> <em>Embed Theme</em> links.
You can also access the <img src="img/stats.png" class="itximg"/>
stats and <img src="img/info.png" class="itximg"/> update information
for the theme to get more background.  If you would like to
contribute, you can apply to become a member by clicking your
status <em>"Following"</em> link.  If you don't know one of the theme
founders, it's a good idea to first establish your reputation by
posting some appropriate membics to your own profile.  You can post
them to the theme later if your membership is accepted.  Leave several
days for your application to be processed.

<li>As a <span class="lititlespan">Member</span> you can post to the
theme.  When you are writing a membic, you will see the theme at the
bottom of the membic editing dialog with a checkbox next to it.
Checking the box will post your membic through to the theme.  If you
accidentally post something, you can edit your membic again and
uncheck the box, or go to the theme and click the title of your membic
to remove it.  In the rare case where you post a membic that is not
appropriate for the theme, it might be removed, so if your membic
doesn't show up when you view the theme, check the theme settings
<img src="img/settings.png" class="hthimg"/> info
<img src="img/info.png" class="itximg"/> button to see if was removed.
To help out with theme administration, apply to become a moderator.
