<h2>Collaborating on a Membic Theme</h2>

<p>Posting links collaboratively extends the variety and increases the
quality of helpful links by reflecting the knowledge and experience of
everyone involved.  Collaboration is powerful, but without trust and
clear process things have a tendency to get messy.  Here's how various
access roles help everyone collaboratively contribute to a theme: </p>

<ol>

<li><span class="lititlespan">Follow</span> a theme to show you are
interested in it, and to gain access to the theme settings
<img src="../img/settings.png" class="ilximg"/> button.  As a follower
you can't make changes, but you can read the
<img src="../img/rssicon.png" class="isximg"/> <em>RSS</em> newsfeed and
<img src="../img/embed.png" class="itximg"/> <em>Embed Theme</em> links.
You can also access the <img src="../img/stats.png" class="itximg"/>
stats and <img src="../img/info.png" class="itximg"/> update information
for the theme to see how active it is.  If you decide you would like to
contribute, you can apply to become a member by clicking your
status <em>"Following"</em> link.  If you don't know one of the theme
founders, it's a good idea to first establish your reputation by
posting some appropriate membics to your own profile.  You can post
them to the theme later if your membership is accepted.  Depending on
how active other people in the theme are, it might take a few days for
your application to be processed.

<li>As a <span class="lititlespan">Member</span> you can post to the
theme.  When you are writing a membic, you will see the theme at the
bottom of the membic editing dialog with a checkbox next to it.
Checking the box will post your membic through to the theme.  If you
accidentally post something, you can edit your membic again and
uncheck the box, or go to the theme and click the title of your membic
to remove it.  In the rare case where you post a membic that is not
appropriate for the theme, it might be removed by an administrator, so
if you can't find your membic, check the <img src="../img/settings.png"
class="ilximg"/> theme settings <img src="../img/info.png"
class="itximg"/> info button to see if your membic was removed and
why.  To help out with theme administration, apply to become a
moderator.

<li>As a <span class="lititlespan">Moderator</span> you see the
<img src="../img/membership.png" class="itximg"/> membership info button
under the theme settings allowing you to view all members.  You will
also see new member applications and you are allowed to accept them on
behalf of the theme.  If you see an innapropriate post, you can click
the title to remove it.  Most of your actions will require you to
state a reason, which will be displayed in the <img src="../img/info.png"
class="itximg"/> update information.  When there are many people
collaborating on a theme, moderators play a crucial role in keeping a
theme on track.  To make changes to the theme description, or remove
members you can apply to become a founder.

<li>As a <span class="lititlespan">Founder</span> you have full access
to all actions possible for a theme, just as if you had created it
yourself.

</ol>

<h3>Invitations</h3>

<p>As a founder or moderator, if you know people you would like as
contributors, you can pre-approve membership and invite someone by
email.  Click the theme title, then click the <em>"Invite"</em> button
next to the social media share icons. </p>


<h3>There if you need it</h3>

<p>In the most common case, collaboratively posting to a theme
involves a small number of people from a group who already know each
other.  These roles may seem a bit formal, but they allow you to grow
and help everyone understand what is going on. </p>
