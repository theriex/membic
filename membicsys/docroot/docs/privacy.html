<p><a name="privacy"> </a><b>Our commitment to privacy: </b></p>

<p>Your privacy is important.  To better protect your privacy we
provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the
choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
</p>


<p><a name="info"> </a><b>The information we collect: </b></p>

<p>Membic.org is a platform for posting publicly viewable information.  The
only private information is your email address, a hash made using your
password that can be used to authenticate you, and a cookie with your access
token that is removed if you sign out. </p>

<p>All other information collected by the site is public.  That includes the
name and image you choose for your profile, descriptive information, membics
you write, themes you are involved with, theme administrative actions, and
anything else not related to signing in. </p>


<p><a name="use"> </a><b>How we use information: </b></p>

<p>We use the public information we collect to help you organize your
membics and make them generally available.  We use your private information
to authenticate you when you sign in, to contact you if you need to reset
your password, and inform you of posts to themes and profiles you are
a member of or following. </p>


<p><a name="security"> </a><b>Our commitment to data security: </b></p>

<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online. </p>


<p><a name="kids"> </a><b>Our commitment to children's privacy: </b></p>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.  For
that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from
those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is
structured to attract anyone under 13. </p>
