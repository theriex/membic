<p>Not every day, but occasionally, I find something online or offline
that is worth remembering.  Sometimes these things come up in
conversation, and I want to be able to quickly find a reference to
pass along.  I'm also interested in what other people find
noteworthy. </p>

<p>Traditional social interactions are pleasant, but unfocused and low
bandwidth.  I'm interested in what a lot of people find memorable, but
there isn't enough time in the day to exchange finds through
traditional conversation.  That's where web collaboration can help.  A
collaborative memory project. </p>

<p>In building this site, it was important that noting something
memorable should be easy and direct.  A quick note to yourself, rather
than an expository critique for others.  Turns out that's more
interesting to read anyway.  With basic identifying information, and
optional tagging, the result is a bite sized structured summary of
something worth remembering.  A membic. </p>

<p>Membic.com makes every effort to be a low noise high quality
collaboration space.  Many discoveries are conversational,
comparatively few are worth remembering.  When you find something
worth remembering, make a membic. </p>
