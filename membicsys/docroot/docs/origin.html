<p>I look through hundreds of articles a day.  Only about one in every
thousand is memorable or worth sharing.  By contrast, books are
usually memorable.  For videos, maybe one in a hundred is worth
sharing.  For movies, maybe one in ten.  Food is also probably around
one in ten.  Activities are almost always worth remembering, because I
want easy access to share links when people visit, and I'll go back to
the same museum multiple times. </p>

<p>To track things, I needed a quick, auto-organizing link noter, but
with a twist: I wanted other people to access my notes just as
easily. </p>

<p>Hassle free public access is very important to me.  I have friends
who enjoy my curated tech articles, and I want them to be able to
easily access my selections over social media or as a newsfeed.  Back in
the day I used to run a mailing list, but it got to be a hassle to
maintain and grow.  I considered a blog, but it was too wordy.  Social
sites were noisy.  Reference systems were cumbersome. </p>

<p>So I set out to build a solution for myself and everyone else.
That way I can enjoy following curated notes from other people at
least as much as my friends enjoy following curated notes from me.  I
wanted a site where quality wins over quantity, who you hear from is
based on trust, and time spent is completely worth it. </p>

<p>Feedback from my tech list taught me that describing <em>why</em> a
link is memorable is just as important as the link itself.  This
link-plus-why pairing needed a name, and so did the site.  The term
"membic" mashes together "memory" and "limbic system", a part of the
brain instrumental in long term memory, emotion, and motivation. </p>

<p>Membic themes were built from membics together with a membership
contribution model.  In working on the model, it became apparent that
a successful membic theme is a form of collaborative memory.  As
you'll see, between collaboration buddies it doesn't matter so much
who made the membic when you are referencing things.  You are
referencing the community memory.  Membic themes go beyond a great way
to share memorable links, creating a great new way to
collaborate. </p>

<p>Looking forward to following your theme. <br/>
