<h2>Embedding a Membic Theme</h2>

<p>Presenting helpful links as part of your website connects your site
with the rest of the world, providing context for visitors and a handy
way for you to track useful links.  But updating your site every time
you find something useful can be a chore.  Here's how to manage and present
helpful links on your website using an embedded membic theme: </p>

<ol>

  <li>Click <img src="img/profile.png" class="hthimg"/> to access
  your profile.

  <li>Click the themes tab <img src="img/tabctms.png" class="hthimg"/>

  <li>Click the <em>"Create cooperative theme"</em> link at the bottom
  of the page, then the <em>"Create New Theme"</em> button.  Choose a
  name that works with your website.  For the description, include
  your website URL.  If you have a hashtag for identifying all your
  helpful links on social media fill that in, otherwise leave it
  blank.  Don't worry, you can edit this information later.  Click
  the <em>"Create Theme"</em> button.

  <li>Your new theme is created and displayed.  Click the settings
  icon <img src="img/settings.png" class="itximg"/> and then click
  the <em>"Choose Image"</em> button.  Upload a recognizable image
  like your website logo.

  <li>Click <img src="img/writenew.png" class="hthimg"/> to write your
  first membic for this theme.  Your new theme will be listed at the
  bottom with a checkbox next to it.  Check that checkbox and save.

  <li>Now that you are done creating a theme and have at least one
  membic in it, open the theme settings <img src="img/settings.png"
  class="itximg"/> then click the <img src="img/embed.png"
  class="itximg"/> <em>"Embed Theme"</em> link.  Copy and paste
  the <em>"Embed script"</em> contents into the website page where you
  want the display.

</ol>

<p>That little snippet of script does everything it can to display
things nicely, but it can be blocked from working.  Here's how to work
around some of the situations that can happen: </p>

<ul>

<li><a href="#pasto" onclick="app.toggledivdisp('pastodiv');return false;">
    <span class="detailheadingspan">Site just shows what was pasted</span></a>
  <div id="pastodiv" class="detailcontentdiv">
The script snippet needs to be inserted directly into the HTML source.
Remove what you pasted, switch your editing mode so all the tags
are visible an try again.  If there is no mode switch, open your
source in a different text editor.
  </div>

<li><a href="#nada" onclick="app.toggledivdisp('nadadiv');return false;">
    <span class="detailheadingspan">Nothing gets displayed</span></a>
  <div id="nadadiv" class="detailcontentdiv">
Your site software might not execute script inside a page.  Remove
what you pasted in, open the <em>"Embed Theme"</em> options and copy
the <em>"Embed iframe"</em> content instead.  Paste that into your
site page and replace YOURSITE.COM with your domain (just your domain,
not your whole website address).
  </div>

<li><a href="#blocked" onclick="app.toggledivdisp('blockeddiv');return false;">
    <span class="detailheadingspan">iframe not allowed</span></a>
  <div id="blockeddiv" class="detailcontentdiv">
Not being allowed to insert external content into your web page is
kind of a drag, but you can still give visitors fast access to your
theme as a standalone microsite.  Insert a link on your page using using the
<em>"Standalone URL"</em> from the <em>"Embed Theme"</em> options.
Visitors clicking that link will go directly to your theme without any
additional wrapper.  You can match the colors to your site palette
using the <em>"Permalink Page Colors"</em> in the theme settings.
  </div>

</ul>

<h2>Custom Keywords</h2>

<p>To make your posted links easier to find and more fun to browse,
consider setting up custom keywords for your membic theme.  The
keywords turn into search radio buttons that provide quick and
intuitive filtering of the links you post. </p>

<p>To manage keywords, open the theme settings
<img src="img/settings.png" class="itximg"/> then click the
<img src="img/tag.png" class="itximg"/> <em>"Theme Keywords"</em>
link.  There is no limit on the number of keywords, but keeping it to
less than 8 or so can make it easier work with.  The keywords you make
available help to educate visitors about the kind of things you post.
Broader concepts are good, a membic can have several keywords
associated with it.</p>


<h2>Posts From Multiple People</h2>

<p>Your embedded theme shows the pen name image with each post, so
different people associated with your website can all contribute.  To
