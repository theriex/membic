<p><a name="privacy"> </a><b>Our commitment to privacy: </b></p>

<p>Your privacy is important.  To better protect your privacy we
provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the
choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
</p>


<p><a name="info"> </a><b>The information we collect: </b></p>

<p>Membic.org is a platform for posting publicly viewable information.  The
only private information we collect is your email address, an optional
alternate email address, contact emails for sharing, a hash made using your
password that can be used to authenticate you, and a cookie with your access
token that is removed when you sign out. </p>

<p>All other information collected by the site is public.  This includes the
name and image you choose for your profile, descriptive information, membics
you write, themes you are involved with, all theme information, and
generally everything else. </p>


<p><a name="use"> </a><b>How we use information: </b></p>

<p>We use the public information we collect to help you organize your
membics and make them generally available.  We use your private information
to authenticate you when you sign in, contact you if you need to reset your
password, inform you of new membics in themes and profiles you are following
via email, help you share membics you post, and inform you of communication
requests, which you can choose to block or respond to directly. </p>

<p>We do not sell your private information.  We do not share your private
information except as required by law or as needed for site administration
purposes. </p>


<p><a name="security"> </a><b>Our commitment to data security: </b></p>

<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online. </p>


<p><a name="kids"> </a><b>Our commitment to children's privacy: </b></p>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.  For
that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from
those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is
structured to attract anyone under 13. </p>
