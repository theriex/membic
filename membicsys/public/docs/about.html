<p>The main page you are viewing shows recent <em>profiles</em> (people)
and <em>themes</em> (collaborative topics).  Each of these membic pages is a
curated collection of membics.  A <em>membic</em> is a link together with a
reason why it is memorable.</p>

<p>Membic.org provides profile and theme pages that can be used for
reference and for news.  Each page has advanced search that makes finding
resources easy, and themes may provide custom keywords to help you quickly
find curated information relevant to you.  Follow any page via webfeed or
email to stay informed of newly added membics.  Membic.org is a free
service.  If you would like to contribute to supporting the site,
