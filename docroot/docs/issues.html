<p>If anything broke, or was hard to use, or could be improved, or if
you have anything else to share, it would be really great to hear from
you! </p>

<p>The best way to get in touch is via the 
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/issues"
 onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/issues');return false">
GitHub issue tracker
</a> which is used for enhancement requests, bugs, and general questions.
Feel free to comment on any of the existing issues or create a new
issue if there isn't one there already. </p>

<p>If the issue board doesn't seem appropriate, or if you are
uncomfortable with using it, then you can
<a href="mailto:theriex@gmail.com?subj=MyOpenReviews">email eric</a>.
</p>

<p>And of course, you can always 
<a href="http://www.myopenreviews.com?newrev=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myopenreviews.com">write a review</a> :-) </p>
