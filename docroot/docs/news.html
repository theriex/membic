<p><b>Connect to MyOpenReviews directly from iTunes on your Mac!</b></p>

<p>Now available for download are 3 scripts you can run directly from
iTunes: <ul>

<li><em>MORSetup</em> connects iTunes to your pen name and sets up
playlists for each music keyword.

<li><em>MORKeywords</em> provides easy keyword, comment and rating
entry for the current track.

<li><em>MORUpdate</em> uploads your review data and refreshes the
content for any keyword playlist.

</ul>

<p>Now you can review your music, sync to MyOpenReviews, and get
automatic playlists based on your own reviews, all right from iTunes!
Cool! </p>

<p>Ok, so this is not exactly a one click install, but you'll be up
and running in a minute or so... </p>

<ol>

<li><a href="../downloads/iTunesMac.zip">Download iTunesMac.zip</a>

<li>Double click the downloaded <code>iTunesMac.zip</code> to expand it.

<li>Double click <code>Install.scpt</code> and it will open in the
AppleScript Editor.  You will see code.  Don't panic.  Just click the
big green "Run" button and quit the AppleScript Editor after it finishes. 

<li>Launch iTunes and select <code>MORSetup</code> from the script menu
(the scrolly looking graphic thingy in the top menu bar).

</ol>

<p>That's it.  You are up and running.  To make it easier to bring up
MORKeywords, you might want to set up a keyboard shortcut.  I went
into my System Preferences, opened "Keyboard" and selected
"Application Shortcuts".  Then I clicked the '+' on the right to
create a new shortcut, selected iTunes as the
application, <code>MORKeywords</code> as the menu title,
and <code>command-;</code> as my keyboard shortcut (iTunes already has
a lot of keybindings already).  That way while I'm in iTunes I just hit
<code>command-;</code> to bring up the MORKeywords script.  Smooth. </p>

<p><b>Directly review items on Amazon, YouTube, and Netflix!</b></p>

<p>If you are looking at something on Amazon, YouTube, or Netflix,
MyOpenReviews now fills out review information for you.  Just select
the MyOpenReviews bookmark link, or paste the site URL into the review
field and the identification fields are automatically filled out!
Nice! </p>

<p>If you don't have the MyOpenReviews bookmark link, you can get it
off the main login page. </p>

<p>Look forward to additional connectors, and bi-directional
connectors, soon. </p>


<p><b>------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

<p><b>Login and post to Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and GitHub!</b></p>

<p>In addition to the core "native" username/password login,
MyOpenReviews now supports logging in via OAuth using your Facebook,
Twitter, Google+, or GitHub account!  So for those of you who
appreciate the convenience of logging in via your social network,
MyOpenReviews just got a lot easier to access.  For those of you who
like to keep your social networks separate, you will be pleased to
know that logging in the traditional username/password way doesn't
automatically load anything extra.  Best of both worlds!  Cool
huh? </p>

<p>Apropos best of both worlds, you can even set up your account for
access from multiple login methods.  In your pen name settings, just
add or remove the login services you want.  So if you previously had a
traditional username/password login and want to be able to access the
same pen name when you are logged into Facebook, just add the Facebook
login service.  Nimble and powerful.  Like motorcycling, or
kiteboarding, or something like that.  Anyway it's pretty neat. </p>
