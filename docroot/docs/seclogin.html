<p>MyOpenReviews uses 
<a href="https://myopenreviews.appspot.com"
   onclick="window.open('https://myopenreviews.appspot.com');return false;">
https://myopenreviews.appspot.com</a>
as a secure server for native login management.  
If it looks like you are getting switched back and forth between
servers, that's because you are.  At least it keeps your password
hidden. </p>

<p>Except for native authentication, everything in MyOpenReviews is
essentially public, so there's not a lot of reason to run https in
general for the site.  Eventually it will probably all run secured
anyway, or at least provide the option. </p>

<p>If you get a warning about some parts of the page not being
secured, that would be the YUI library (Yahoo APIs) which are
currently only available via http.  If you can think of a scenario
where that would actually be unsafe, please post it to the issues
forum. </p>
