<p>MyOpenReviews is currently <em>pre-Alpha</em>.  Many basic features
are available, but nothing is really tested and there are several
things left to do before generally announcing the site.  You may find
problems while using the site, feel free to report anything you run
into.  Your feedback is greatly appreciated. </p>
