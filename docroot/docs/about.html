  <title>About MyOpenReviews</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>MyOpenReviews is a "follow" style social net built over a powerful
review creation and management platform. </p>

<p>You use MyOpenReviews to bridge between experiencing things and
communicating those experiences.  For example when you read a book,
you can write a quick review of it, then share that review with your
friends.  Your reviews are saved for easy access, so you and your
friends can always find what books you've been into.  MyOpenReviews
supports books, movies, videos, music, food, drink and other
stuff. </p>

<p>You write reviews under a chosen pen name, so you can reveal as
much or as little of yourself as you want. </p>

<p>This is a community of reviewers supported by a community of
developers.  It is a work in progress, and open to participation.  New
connection services are being developed and existing capabilities
improved.  Check it out. </p>

<p><em>MyOpenReviews is currently pre-Alpha.  Many basic features are
available, but it is not fully tested and there are still things left
to do.  If you run into anything strange or have a suggestion, please
leave a note on the
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/issues"
 onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/issues');return false">GitHub project</a>.  It would be great to hear from you. </em></p>
