  <title>About MyOpenReviews</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>MyOpenReviews is an open experimental hub built to try and address
some nagging questions: </p>

<ol>

<li>If I listen to a song on one site and note that I like it, can
that propagate through to the other music services I use?  Can I track
all of that in one place?

<li>Is it possible to track my reviews so my friends or myself can
easily find my favorite songs of all time, and what I've been into
recently?  Can that also work for books and other things?

<li>Can networking about media be a better way to find things I would
probably like?  Is it possible to network without tying my real life
professional identity to all my reviews?

<li>Will better tools make it worth reviewing more things?  Is it cool
to have a library of impressions?  Can a smart program automatically
find things for me based on my mood or what I'm doing?

</ol>

<p>That's kind of what's going on.  Want to see how it goes?  Join
up!  </p>
