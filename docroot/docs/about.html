<body>

<p>MyOpenReviews is a deep and intuitive review interface built over
an open data platform supporting a community of connection services.
Write a review using one of your chosen pen names, then automatically
post through to the social and content sites you've selected. </p>

<p>With MyOpenReviews, content service ratings and passing comments to
friends continue to work just like they do now, but you add easy
access to your top 20 lists, recent reviews, search capabilities and
other fun features. </p>

<p>This is a work in progress, and an open community.  New connection
services are being developed and existing capabilities improved.  
Check it out. </p>
