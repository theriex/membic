<p>What aspects were good? What aspects were not? Was it worth your
time? Would you repeat the experience? Would you recommend it?</p>

<p>When friends write reviews, it's worth reading to hear their
reactions. Friends help you experience new things you might enjoy. </p>

<h2 class="headingtxt">Who this is for</h2>
<div class="aboutstatementsdiv">

<p><span class="brandspan">WDYDFun</span> is a hype-phobic source of
trusted information shared at comfortable levels of anonymity.  If you
can articulate your experiences, slow-steady networking values your
thoughts as much as what you choose to review. With WDYDFun you
can: </p>

<ul>
<li>Automatically track your current top 20 favorite experiences.
<li>Share your personal review log page with your recent and top posts.
<li>Create and join groups devoted to specific themes.
<li>See recent and top reviews from friends.
<li>Remember or pre-review things you want to check out later.
<li>Track and search your reviews.  Track and search reviews from your friends.
<li>Fine tune which types of reviews you follow from each of your friends.
<li>Get introduced to new friends through advanced search.
<li>Easily review books, movies, videos, music, food, drinks, activities
  and anything else that has a URL or physical location.
<li>Share your reviews anywhere you can post a URL.
</ul>
