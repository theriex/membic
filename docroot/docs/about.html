your friends, and keeps track of reviews you've remembered. </p>

<p>This is a community of pen names, so you can reveal as much or as
little about yourself as you want.  Check in at your own pace. </p>

<p>To use MyOpenReviews, just write a review and post through to your
existing social networks. <p>
