  <title>About MyOpenReviews</title>
</head>
<body>


<p>MyOpenReviews helps people build shared experiences around fun
things to do, food, drink, music, videos, movies, books and anything
else that can be reviewed.  When you review something, you can post
the review through to your social networks, and anyone following you
can see what you've checked out recently.  Likewise you can see what
your friends have been into. </p>

<p>What makes MyOpenReviews different is that in addition to activity
feeds, you can also check out your friend's updated top 20 best
reviews of all time, and click to remember any review you want to
check out later.  MyOpenReviews is a community of pen names, so
you can reveal as much or as little about yourself as you want. </p>

<p>You can use the MyOpenReviews bookmarklet to quickly create a
review from any page on the internet. </p>

<p><em>MyOpenReviews is currently pre-Alpha.  Many basic features are
available, but it is not fully tested and there are still things left
to do.  This is a community of reviewers supported by a community of
developers.  It is a work in progress, and open to participation.
If you run into anything strange or have a suggestion, please
