<p>Welcome to a community of pen names where you can share reviews of
things to read, watch, listen to, eat, drink and more.  Follow people
whose tastes you trust, inspire others to experience new things, and
build relationships through shared experiences. </p>

<p><b>wdydfun</b> is part of <i>MyOpenReviews</i>, an open source
platform for social review sharing.  The goal is to enable sharing
detailed impressions without requiring a full dossier of personal
details.  Here creative names are as valid as real names, and your
reputation is built on the reviews you share.  Check in at your own
pace. </p>

<p><b>wdydfun</b> will always be free.  The site is supported by limited
advertising, sales commissions and voluntary contributions.  It is
open to participation at all levels. </p>

<p>Contact: If you have a suggestion to increase the awesomeness of the site,
or if you have a question, or if you bump into something that doesn't
work right, please open an issue on the
