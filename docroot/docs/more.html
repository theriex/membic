    <p class="tagline">For easy reviewing, "right click" the following link and add it to your bookmarks:</p>

    <div class="bookmarkletlinkdiv">
      <a href="javascript:(function(){window.open('http://www.fgfweb.com?newrev=&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href));})();"
         style="border: 2px solid #999; padding:2px; background:#ccc; font-weight:bold;">FGFweb&nbsp;post</a>
    </div>

    <p class="tagline">This magic link is called a "bookmarklet",
    which is a fancy name for a line of javascript that opens up
    FGFweb in a new browser window, passing along the url of the site
    you were just on.  Voila, instant review details. </p>

<p>If you prefer to open FGFweb using the same window, add this bookmarklet instead: 
<a href="javascript:(function(){window.location.href='http://www.fgfweb.com?newrev=&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);})();">
FGFweb&nbsp;same&nbsp;window</a>
</p>

<!-- Haven't seen this be a problem of late...
<p class="smalltext">You might need to allow popup windows from FGFweb
depending on your browser. </p>  -->

<p><b>------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

<p><b>Connect to FGFweb directly from iTunes!</b></p>

<p>There are 3 AppleScript files that enable you to quickly review
tracks within iTunes, and also create playlists based on ratings and
keywords: </p>

<ul>

<li><b>FGFwebExport</b> copies source tracks for any playlist out
to another folder.

<li><b>FGFwebPlaylist</b> creates or updates the contents of any
playlist built from the keywords and rating you specified.

<li><b>FGFwebReview</b> updates the keywords, comments, rating and
play frequency for the current track.

</ul>

<p>The review process uses the <code>Comments</code> field to track
extra information like relevant keywords, how often a track should be
automatically selected, and any additional comments you might have.
The playlist creation process matches combinations of keywords, rating
stars and play frequency to automatically build custom playlists for
any situation.  The export utility will copy the contents of any
playlist to another folder and is handy for moving files to other
places like an Android phone. </p>

<p>To get your FGFweb script support for iTunes: </p>
<ol>

<li><a href="../downloads/iTunesMac.zip">Download iTunesMac.zip</a>

<li>Double click the downloaded <code>iTunesMac.zip</code> to expand it.

<li>Double click <code>Install.scpt</code> to open it in the
AppleScript Editor.  Click the big green "Run" button and quit the
AppleScript Editor after it finishes.

<li>From iTunes, select a script from the scrolly looking thingy in
the top menu bar.

</ol>

<p>You might find it handy to set up a keyboard shortcut for
FGFwebReview: </p>

<ol>

<li>Open System Preferences | "Keyboard" | "Application Shortcuts"

<li>Click '+' to add a new shortcut

<li>Select "iTunes" as the application, <code>FGFwebReview</code> as
the menu title, and <code>command-;</code> as the keyboard shortcut
(iTunes already has default keybindings for most other keys).

</ol>

<!-- Had this set with "../stats" as the href and 'stats" as the
window to open onclick. That works great for testing, but breaks search.
Using the fully qualified url instead. -->

<a href="http://www.fgfweb.com/stats" 
   onclick="window.open('http://www.fgfweb.com/stats');return false">stats</a>
