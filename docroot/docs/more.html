    <p class="tagline">For easy reviewing, bookmark this link:</p>

    <div class="bookmarkletlinkdiv">
      <a href="javascript:(function(){window.open('http://www.wdydfun.com?newrev=&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href));})();"
         style="border: 2px solid #999; padding:2px; background:#ccc; font-weight:bold;">wdydfun&nbsp;link</a>
    </div>

    <p class="tagline">then surf to any page on the internet and select the bookmark to kick off the review process.
If you prefer to not open a new window for your review, bookmark this link instead: 
<a href="javascript:(function(){window.location.href='http://www.wdydfun.com?newrev=&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);})();">
wdydfun&nbsp;same&nbsp;window</a>
</p>

  <p class="smalltext">You might need to allow popup windows from wdydfun
depending on your browser. </p>

<p><b>Weekly activity summary email</b></p>

<p>The activity summary email is now organized by review type, and you
can manage the frequency from your profile account settings.  By
default the review summary is sent weekly, which is an easy way to
keep up with reviews from friends. </p>

<p>If you didn't provide an email address when you first signed up,
you can still add one by opening your profile settings and clicking
the account settings link.  Providing an email address is a good idea
since you will need it if you ever need to recover your account. </p>

<p><b>Connect to wdydfun directly from iTunes on your Mac!</b></p>

<p>Now available for download are 3 scripts you can run directly from
iTunes: <ul>

<li><em>MORSetup</em> connects iTunes to your pen name and sets up
playlists for each music keyword.

<li><em>MORKeywords</em> provides easy keyword, comment and rating
entry for the current track.

<li><em>MORUpdate</em> uploads your review data and refreshes the
content for any keyword playlist.

</ul>

<p>Now you can review your music, sync to wdydfun, and get automatic
playlists based on your own reviews, all right from iTunes!
Cool! </p>

<p>Ok, so this is not exactly a one click install, but you'll be up
and running in a minute or so... </p>

<ol>

<li><a href="../downloads/iTunesMac.zip">Download iTunesMac.zip</a>

<li>Double click the downloaded <code>iTunesMac.zip</code> to expand it.

<li>Double click <code>Install.scpt</code> and it will open in the
AppleScript Editor.  You will see code.  Don't panic.  Just click the
big green "Run" button and quit the AppleScript Editor after it finishes. 

<li>Launch iTunes and select <code>MORSetup</code> from the script menu
(the scrolly looking graphic thingy in the top menu bar).

</ol>

<p>That's it.  You are up and running.  To make it easier to bring up
MORKeywords, you might want to set up a keyboard shortcut.  I went
into my System Preferences, opened "Keyboard" and selected
"Application Shortcuts".  Then I clicked the '+' on the right to
create a new shortcut, selected iTunes as the
application, <code>MORKeywords</code> as the menu title,
and <code>command-;</code> as my keyboard shortcut (iTunes already has
a lot of keybindings already).  That way while I'm in iTunes I just hit
<code>command-;</code> to bring up the MORKeywords script.  Smooth. </p>
