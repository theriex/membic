    <p class="tagline">For easy posts, "right click" the following link and add it to your bookmarks:</p>

    <div class="bookmarkletlinkdiv">
      <a href="javascript:(function(){window.open('http://www.fgfweb.com?newrev=&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href));})();"
         style="border: 2px solid #999; padding:2px; background:#ccc; font-weight:bold;">FGFweb&nbsp;post</a>
    </div>

    <p class="tagline">This magic link is called a "bookmarklet",
    which is a fancy name for a line of javascript that opens up
    FGFweb in a new browser window, passing along the url of the site
    you were just on.  Voila, instant posting details! </p>

<p>If you prefer to open FGFweb using the same window, add this bookmarklet instead: 
<a href="javascript:(function(){window.location.href='http://www.fgfweb.com?newrev=&url='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);})();">
FGFweb&nbsp;same&nbsp;window</a>
</p>

<!-- Haven't seen this be a problem of late...
<p class="smalltext">You might need to allow popup windows from FGFweb
depending on your browser. </p>  -->

<p><b>------------------------------------------------------------</b></p>

<p><b>Connect to FGFweb directly from iTunes!</b></p>

<p>These 3 AppleScript files enable to you to characterize your tracks
and automatically build situational playlists: <p>

<ul>

<li><b>FGFwebReview</b> is run anytime you are listening to a track.
It prompts you to select appropriate keywords, provide an overall
rating, decide how often the track should be selected, and add any
other comments you want.

<li><b>FGFwebPlaylist</b> creates or updates a playlist built from
keyword values and a minimum quality rating, not including anything
that has been selected too recently.

<li><b>FGFwebExport</b> copies the playlist and source tracks out to
another folder.  Handy for putting music on an Android phone.

</ul>

<p>The scripts work directly within iTunes using the rating and
comment fields.  No modifications are required, and existing field
values are preserved. <p>

<p>To get your FGFweb script support for iTunes: </p>
<ol>

<li><a href="../downloads/iTunesMac.zip">Download iTunesMac.zip</a>

<li>Double click the downloaded <code>iTunesMac.zip</code> to expand it.

<li>Double click <code>Install.scpt</code> to open it in the
AppleScript Editor.  Click the big green "Run" button and quit the
AppleScript Editor after it finishes.

<li>From iTunes, select a script from the scrolly looking thingy in
the top menu bar.

</ol>

<p>You might find it handy to set up a keyboard shortcut for
FGFwebReview: </p>

<ol>

<li>Open System Preferences | "Keyboard" | "Application Shortcuts"

<li>Click '+' to add a new shortcut

<li>Select "iTunes" as the application, <code>FGFwebReview</code> as
the menu title, and <code>command-;</code> as the keyboard shortcut
(iTunes already has default keybindings for most other keys).

</ol>

<!-- Had this set with "../stats" as the href and 'stats" as the
window to open onclick. That works great for testing, but breaks search.
Using the fully qualified url instead. -->

<p>
<a href="http://www.fgfweb.com/stats" 
   onclick="window.open('http://www.fgfweb.com/stats');return false">stats</a>
