<body>

<p>All the server calls used by the MyOpenReviews site are also
available for your direct use.  So if you would like to build a custom
data synchronization module or anything else you think might be
useful, you have the exactly the same capabilities as this site. </p>

<p>The application programming interface is currently under
development.  The goal is to make the server side self-describing so
the descriptions stay up to date.  There will be a link here as soon
as that is availble... </p>
