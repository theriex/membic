  <title>API MyOpenReviews</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>All the server calls used by the MyOpenReviews site are available
for general use. </p>

<p>The API consists of HTTP GET or POST calls that return results
formatted as JSON (XML and CSV options coming later).  To make sure
the API documentation stays in sync with what is actually available,
the docs are maintained in source code, specifically
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/blob/master/app.yaml"
   onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/blob/master/app.yaml');return false">app.yaml</a>, 
where the server endpoints are defined. Take a look there to see
descriptions of what is available. </p>

<p>For details on processing, including data structures, reference the
python source for the defined script module.  For example if you want
to read the <code>/login</code>
script <code>src.py.moracct.app</code>, you would look at
<code>myopenreviews/src/py/moracct.py</code> for details. </p>

<p>Questions, suggestions, corrections, any and all feedback on
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/issues"
 onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/issues');return false">GitHub</a>.
