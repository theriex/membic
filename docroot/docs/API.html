  <title>API MyOpenReviews</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>All the server calls used by the MyOpenReviews site are available
for general use. </p>

<p>The API consists of HTTP GET or POST calls, with results formatted
as JSON, XML, or CSV.  Rather than maintain separate documentation to
describe each of the possible server endpoints and how they are used,
the mappings are described directly in the actual source.  To see the
API, check out 
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/blob/master/app.yaml"
   onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/myopenreviews/blob/master/app.yaml');return false">app.yaml</a> </p>

<p>If you want to delve deeper into the processing for any url/script
pairing, you can substitute the dots in the associated script to read
the source.  For example if you want to read the <code>/login</code>
script <code>src.py.moracct.app</code>, check
out <code>myopenreviews/src/py/moracct.py</code>. </p>

<p>Questions, suggestions, corrections, pull requests etc. are very
welcome. </p>
