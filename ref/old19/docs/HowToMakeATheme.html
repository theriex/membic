<p>A Theme holds membics related to an ongoing interest or purpose.  Here's
how to make a theme: </p>

<ol>

  <li>Click <img src="../img/profile.png" class="hthimg"/> to access
  your profile.

  <li>Select <img src="../img/tabctms.png" class="hthimg"/> (your themes tab).

  <li>Open the <em>Create cooperative theme</em> link and press the
  <b>Create New Theme</b> button.

  <li>Fill out the name and description. If there's a hashtag you would like
  to use, fill that in, otherwise you can fill it in later if you want.
  Click the <b>Create Theme</b> button.

  <li>After your theme is created, click settings
  <img src="../img/settings.png" class="itximg"/> to upload a logo or image
  to help identify your theme visually.

</ol>

<p>The next time you <a class="localdocslink"
href="HowToWriteAMembic.html">write a membic</a>, you'll see your theme
listed with a checkbox next to it.  Check the checkbox to post your membic
to your theme. </p>

<h2>Sharing, Collaboration, Keywords and Other Features</h2>

<p>Click your theme name to show popular social media share buttons, the
direct access link for your theme, and the invite button.  The invite button
allows you to invite people to follow your theme, or pre-approve them as
contributing members.  If you're not quite ready for that yet, you can skip
this section. </p>

<p>Themes provide easy access to membics as a newsfeed, as an up-to-date
"top 20" list, or via keyword/text search.  Themes were built for
collaboration, reflecting the knowledge and experience of multiple people.
Here's how you can be involved with a theme: </p>

<ol>

<li>You can <span class="lititlespan">Follow</span> a theme to show you are
interested in what gets posted.  Followers can't post, but they can read
settings information like the <img src="../img/rssicon.png"
class="isximg"/> <em>RSS</em> newsfeed, <img src="../img/embed.png"
class="itximg"/> <em>Embed Theme</em> code, <img src="../img/stats.png"
class="itximg"/> stats, and <img src="../img/info.png" class="itximg"/>
informational updates.

<li>A <span class="lititlespan">Member</span> can post to the theme.

<li>A <span class="lititlespan">Moderator</span> is Member with the
additional power to remove innapropriate posts from other Members, view
<img src="../img/membership.png" class="itximg"/> membership, and
accept new membership applications.

<li>A <span class="lititlespan">Founder</span> has full access to
everything.

</ol>

<p>You can apply to move up a level, or resign to move down a level.
Applications are reviewed, and Founders retain the power to revoke
membership rights of non-Founders.  Cooperative themes are designed to
handle collaborative posting from 5 to 50 members. </p>

<h3>Custom Keywords</h3>

<p>Themes support custom keywords to help categorize membics.  The keywords
turn into search radio buttons that provide quick and intuitive filtering on
the search tab.  If you are not sure what keywords you want, wait until you
have 10-15 membics to get an idea of what might work well.  You can
add or edit keywords at any time. </p>

<p>To manage keywords, open the theme settings
<img src="../img/settings.png" class="itximg"/> then click the
<img src="../img/tag.png" class="itximg"/> <em>"Theme Keywords"</em> link.
There is no limit on the number of keywords, but keeping it to less than 8
or so can make it easier work with.  Keywords help to educate visitors about
the kinds of membics available in the theme.  Broader concepts are good.
Each membic can have multiple keywords associated with it.</p>
