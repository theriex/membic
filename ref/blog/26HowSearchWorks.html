<!-- How Membic Search Works -->

Search is the bridge from what you actively remember into everything that you have found memorable.  When searching membics written by someone else, you build on their expertise to enhance your own.  For a simple input box, search has a lot of power.  Here is quick overview of things you can do with search.


<h2>Simple and fast</h2>

If you have some idea what you are looking for, just type in a search term and go.  For example in a social justice theme you might search for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>racism</em>
to get back all of the membics where "racism" occurs anywhere in the membic, whether capitalized or not.

Want to add a second search term?  Here are the ways you can do that:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><em>anti&#8209;black&nbsp;racism</em></td>
    <td>Search for "anti-black" OR "racism" anywhere in the membic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>anti&#8209;black&nbsp;+racism</em></td>
    <td>Search for "anti-black" AND "racism" anywhere in the membic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>"anti&#8209;black&nbsp;racism"</em></td>
    <td>Search for the exact phrase "anti-black racism" as if it were a single word, anywere in the membic</td>
  </tr>
</table>

That should help you zoom in pretty quickly if you know what you are looking for.  But what if you don't know what kinds of membics are available?


<h2>Keywords and scopes</h2>

When viewing a theme, open the search box without typing anything into it and you will get a list of keywords available for the theme.  The keywords show you the kinds of membics available.

When searching by keyword, the scope is set by default to only match membics with that associated keyword.  For example if you choose "Solidarity" from the keywords, the search box will show "in keywords: Solidarity", meaning that only membics with "Solidarity" in the keywords will match.  If you want to find "Solidarity" anywhere in the membic, you can remove the "in keywords:" part of the search.

These are the available search scopes:
<ul>
<li><em>in keywords</em>: Match if the search term is found in the keywords.
<li><em>in details</em>: Match if the search term is found in the details.
<li><em>in url</em>: Match if the search term is found in the link url.
</ul>

The "in url" scope is particularly useful if you are interested in a specific web source.  For example "in url: nytimes" gets you all the membics describing links to articles from the New York Times.

The "in details" scope matches only the link title and supporting information provided by the website (e.g. author, publisher, artist).  It does not match the text or the url.  Not all websites provide consistent detail information, but it can be a useful scope for searching across those that do.

That's it.  To try out your new found search power, choose any theme that interests you from the <a href="https://membic.org/connect">main Membic page</a>.
