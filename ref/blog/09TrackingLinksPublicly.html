Tracking Links Publicly

If your ongoing interest fits somewhere in the range between amateur curiosity and professional research, you need a way to track things of interest that you discover.  Assuming you are not averse to helping others and building your reputation along the way, tracking links publicly is a great way to go... with some important considerations:

<h2>Easy</h2>

Noting a link to something has to be easy.  If it takes too long to do, it doesn't happen.  We're all busy.

It's reasonable to expect noting a link should be much easier than writing a blog entry.  Some links merit significant description, but in most cases a sentence is enough.  But you should expect to write something; links without any of your thoughts don't really help anybody much.

To make noting a link easier, look for things like automatic link source parsing, autocomplete for book titles, simple keyword entry, duplicate entry detection, quick importance rating, and share buttons connecting to where you commonly post.

<h2>Safe</h2>

It would be great if all discussions were thoughtful and respectful, but you should probably skip supporting general comments.  If someone has something to say about a link they can note the link themselves. Rely on your existing social networks, then get simple structured feedback through buttons to mark something as helpful, or to remember something for later.

The amount of personal information you divulge should always be clear and under your control.  It should be clear what you are presenting, and more than that shouldn't be available for anyone.

Providing helpful information to the public is of benefit to the community, and technology platforms have a responsibility to support constructive processes against common destructive patterns.  If you decide you don't want to hear from someone, it should be easy to filter them out.

<h2>Powerful</h2>

It should be possible to set up keywords specific to your ongoing interest so you can easily peruse the links you have noted.  That's in addition to standard text based search.

The links you post should be accessible how you want: as a standalone site, embedded in your own site, or via a news reader.  And they should look good.
