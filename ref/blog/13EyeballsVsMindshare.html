<!-- Eyeballs vs Mindshare -->

The battle for eyeballs is pretty much over.  If you are one of the popular
few that have managed to rise above the din, congratulations.  Regardless
whether you've made it already or not, expect that maintaining your
visibility is going to get more difficult, and more hierarchical, as the
noise level continues to increase.

What if you don't have time to post all day every day while feverishly
monitoring all your social media feeds? 

You are going to post less.  Make it count.


<h2>What to post and where</h2>

The first step in communicating more effectively is to differentiate between
ephemeral and memorable. What you had for lunch is ephemeral. An article
explaining something really well is memorable.

Continue to do whatever you do with the ephemeral. For memorable things,
first post it somewhere for reference, then do whatever with it.  Where you
post depends on how you are reacting and interacting with it.

<ol>

<li><h3>Blog</h3> If you can write a couple of paragraphs about your
reaction to something, write a blog entry.  I use WordPress, YMMV.  If you
don't currently have a blog, setting up and getting started will take an
hour or two, but after that creating a new blog entry is simply
create/edit/save.  If you have a website, make sure your site references
your blog, and your blog references your site.

<li><h3>Reference</h3> If you just want to keep a link, along with a
sentence why something is memorable, create an entry in reference links
list.  I use Membic, YMMV.  If you don't currently have a list to track your
references, setting up a membic will take an hour or so, but after that you
just write/edit/save.  If you have a website, you can easily embed the
reference links from the theme as a page within your site.

<li><h3>Calendar</h3> If something is time dependent, put it on a public
calendar.  I use Google Calendar, YMMV. You (and anyone else) can overlay
your public calendar on top of your personal calendar for a complete view of
what is going on.  If you have a website, you can easily embed the calendar
as a page within your site.

</ol>

These approaches can be combined, for example you could post a reference
link to your blog article or write a reaction to a calendar event, but
that's not necessary if they all point back to your website.  After saving,
share it on social media.  Your social media presence will be the same or
slightly improved without requiring any more time, and you gain a more
permanent general web presence helping you and others who are interested.


<h2>How to monitor</h2>

Getting back to feverishly monitoring all your social media all day
long trying to keep up.

It's ok to let that go every once in a while.

Make up for it by contacting every one of your friends whose longer term
insights are valuable to you and asking what they do with their memorable
stuff.  Don't do that directly.  Some people are frequently dismayed to
consider that not every word they breathe is memorable.  Ask if they have a
blog, or keep a reference list for the things you are most interested in
from them.

Now use an aggregate monitor to track all those sources via RSS.  I use
Feedly, YMMV.  The comparative volume of what you need to keep up with is
vastly lower, the quality is significantly higher, it's faster to scan, and
easier to track.  It might not add another day to your week, but it could
come close.  Spend your new free time perusing social media without having
to worry as much about keeping up.


<h2>Talk to your friends about RSS</h2>

Like email, RSS is older technology.  It's not as old as email, but it's
definitely an old school web approach from a time before some of the web
giants were quite as giant.  It's seriously powerful, and it's seriously
underutilized.  Many people I've talked to haven't even heard of it, so it
seems worth a quick mention.

Newspapers, news channels, blogs, reference lists, and many other web
sources have RSS feeds.  Using a feed reader, you can gather all the sources
you read into a single comprehensive overview that keeps track of what
you've read and lets you see what's new where.  It rocks, and you should
definitely check it out.
