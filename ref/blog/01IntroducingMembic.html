<h1>Introducing Membic: Trusted Collaborative Memory</h1>

<p>What if you could easily recall and communicate references related
to an ongoing topic of interest?  What if you were part of a group
that could pool relevant references into a common memory? </p>

<p>If amplifying your ability to track and publicize noteworthy
references sounds interesting, read on. </p>


<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>A <b><i>membic</i></b> is a core building block for reference
tracking and selective access.  It consists of a link, combined with a
sentence from you about why it is memorable, plus an overall rating
and any associated keywords you want.  A link is an identifying
description and/or URL referencing a specific media element, physical
place, activity or other identifiable item. </p>

<p>When you find something worth remembering, make a membic to capture
a link and why it is memorable.  Don't worry about the wording, just a
phrase or two why you think it is noteworthy.  You can always edit
later.  Remember that why you feel something is memorable may be more
important than the thing itself. </p>

<p>A <b><i>theme</i></b> is a collection of membics related to a
particular topic of interest.  Themes can be accessed directly via
permalink or hashtag, can be embedded in a website, or accessed as
a newsfeed.  Anyone can follow a theme, but only members may
post. Additional membership privileges related to maintaining the
theme as a whole are granted to moderators and founders. </p>

<p>If the membic you are making relates to an ongoing interest, and
there is already a theme set up, check the theme checkbox to post
through.  Otherwise, if you've accumulated a few related membics, go
ahead and create a new theme.  As a theme founder, you have complete
control over members and content. </p>

<p>Membics are reference building blocks, and why a link is memorable
forms the basis of collaboration.  To extend to social conversation,
post any membic or theme to social media.  To provide a newsfeed, use
the RSS link from your theme settings.  To make a website, use the
theme permalink or hashtag link. Collaborative memory results from
cooperative posting and refinement within themes. Cross collaboration
is encouraged through a filtered community overview. </p>

<p>You create membics and post them through to themes as part of the
free collaborative memory project at
<a href="https://membic.com">membic.com</a>.</p>


<h2>Rewards</h2>

<p>In the past, collaborative memory was not a real possibility.  Even
tools for reference sharing were limited, so piles of unused
bookmarks, links scattered through email, and other ad hoc solutions
have been normal. However, at this point noting references on your own
is a bit like writing a paper you only read yourself.  There's so much
more available potential. </p>

<p>As an individual, a primary benefit is being able to track, easily
access, and communicate noteworthy references. A secondary benefit is
being able to note references across a wide variety of interests
without having to use a different app or website for each one.  The
process can be quite rewarding, especially if you are burnt out on
bookmarks, appreciate having a place for things, or are seeking to
make your curated references available to others.</p>

<p>For a collaborative group, a primary benefit is enabling
collaborative memory through common reference.  Having an easily
accessible, up to date common reference site provides some foundation
for shared understanding.  A secondary benefit is the reflection of
trust and appropriate involvement provided by group membership access
levels which aid in group management and growth. </p>


<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>To get a feel for how membics work, sign up at
<a href="https://membic.com">membic.com</a> and post the top five
links you currently remember.  When you discover something new that is
worth remembering, make a membic.  See how others in the community are
using the site.  When you are ready, create or join a theme devoted to
a topic of interest to you. </p>
