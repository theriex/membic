<h1>Introducing Membic: Trusted Collaborative Memory</h1>

What if you could easily recall and communicate links or references related to an ongoing topic of interest? What if you were part of a group that could pool relevant resources into a common memory?

If amplifying your ability to track and publicize noteworthy links, sounds interesting, read on.


<h2>What is it?</h2>

A <b><i>membic</i></b> is a core building block for reference tracking and selective access.  It consists of a link, combined with a sentence from you about why it is memorable, plus an overall rating and any associated keywords you want. A link is an identifying description and/or URL referencing a specific media element, physical place, activity or other identifiable item. 

When you find something worth remembering, make a membic to capture a link.  Be sure to include a phrase or two to describe why you think it is noteworthy.  Remember that why something is memorable may be more important than the thing itself.  Don't worry about the wording, you can always edit it later. 

A <b><i>theme</i></b> is a collection of membics related to a particular topic of interest.  If the membic you are making relates to other membics, you are on your way to a theme.  A theme connects and collects membics around an ongoing interest, which can be shared with others. Once you've accumulated a few related membics, go ahead and create a new theme. 

Themes can be accessed directly via permalink or hashtag, can be embedded in a website, or accessed as a newsfeed. Anyone can follow a theme, but only members may post. Additional membership privileges related to maintaining the theme as a whole are granted to moderators and founders.  As a theme founder, you have complete control over members and content.

Membics are the building blocks of collaborative memory, a process that creates connections around shared interests and the reasons why links are memorable.  To extend collaborative memory to social conversation, post any membic or theme to social media. To provide a newsfeed, use the RSS link from your theme settings.  To make a website, use the theme permalink or hashtag link.  Collaborative memory results from cooperative posting and refinement within themes. Cross collaboration is encouraged through a filtered community overview.

You create membics and post them through to themes as part of the free collaborative memory project at <a href="https://membic.org">membic.org</a>.


<h2>Rewards</h2>

In the past, tools for reference sharing were limited, so piles of unused bookmarks, links scattered through email, and other ad hoc solutions have been normal, but frustrating.  The lack of tools meant that collaborative memory was not a real possibility.  With the expanded capacity of membics, ad hoc link tracking on your own is a bit like writing a paper you only read yourself. There's so much more available potential now. 

As an individual, a primary benefit is being able to track, easily access, and communicate noteworthy links and references. A secondary benefit is being able to note different and multiple types of links and references without having to use a separate app or website for each one. The process can actually be rewarding, especially if you are burnt out on bookmarks, appreciate having a place for things, or are seeking to make your curated references available to others.

For a group, or even individuals who share similar interests, a primary benefit is enabling collaborative memory through common reference. Having an easily accessible, up to date common reference site provides some foundation for shared understanding. A secondary benefit is the reflection of trust and appropriate involvement provided by different levels of theme membership access which aid in group management and growth.
